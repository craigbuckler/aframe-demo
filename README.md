# A-Frame demonstrations

A collection of experimental Virtual and Augmented Reality A-Frame code presented by [Craig Buckler](https://twitter.com/craigbuckler) at the [TechExeter Conference 2017](https://techexeter.uk/conference/).

## Usage

Either:

1. Copy the files to a web server folder then open `index.html` in your browser, or
2. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed then run `node server.js` and navigate to `http://localhost:8888`.
